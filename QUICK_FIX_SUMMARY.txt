# 🎯 Attendance Bug Fix - Summary

## What Was Broken
```
Error: QCoreApplication::exec: The event loop is already running
App crashed when clicking "Start Attendance"
```

## What Was Wrong
The dashboard runs a Qt event loop. When you clicked "Start Attendance", the code tried to start ANOTHER event loop - which Qt doesn't allow.

## What Was Fixed
**Removed the problematic line:**
```python
sys.exit(app.exec_())  # ❌ Was causing crash
```

Now the code just shows the window and returns to the dashboard's event loop.

## Result
✅ **Attendance now works without crashing!**

---

## Quick Test

```powershell
# 1. Start app
python main.py

# 2. Register a student (if not done)
# - Click "Register Student"
# - Take a photo

# 3. Click "🎥 Start Attendance"
# - Select unit
# - Click "Start"
# - Show your face to camera
```

**Expected Result:** Face recognized → Attendance marked → No crashes

---

## Files Changed
- `run_attendance.py` - Removed `app.exec_()` call

**Status:** ✅ Ready to use!
